# VBA-Scripts-Macro

A Script is the code that tells the macro what to do.

## Overview

**VBA-Scripts-Macro** is a collection of scripts designed to automate tasks and enhance productivity using macros. Each script defines specific logic that guides macro execution, making repetitive or complex tasks easier and more efficient.

> **Note:** While the repository name references "VBA", the current implementation uses **TypeScript** for scripting and automation logic.

## Features

- Modular scripts for a variety of automation scenarios
- Clear and well-documented TypeScript code
- Easily extendable for new macro requirements
